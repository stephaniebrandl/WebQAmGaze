<p class="webgaze-experiment-compact" id="paragraph">In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned <span id="meco_para_3_qa_1">performance-enhancing drugs by athletic competitors</span>. The term doping is widely used by organizations which regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is largely considered unethical, and is therefore prohibited by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. Furthermore, athletes who take explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating. Despite its prevalence in the headlines recently, doping is not a new phenomenon; in fact, it is as old as sport itself. From the use of substances <span id="meco_para_3_qa_3">in ancient chariot races</span> to more recent controversies <span id="meco_para_3_qa_2">in baseball and cycling</span>, popular views among athletes have varied widely over the years. In recent decades, authorities and sporting organizations have tried to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The primary reasons for this ban are the <span id="meco_para_3_qa_0">health risks of performance-enhancing drugs</span>, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the positive example to the public set by drug-free sport. Anti-doping authorities have repeatedly emphasized that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the 'spirit of sport'.</p>`,

<p class="webgaze-experiment-compact" id="paragraph">Wine tasting is the sensory examination and evaluation of wine. While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the late middle ages onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. In recent years, <span id="meco_para_7_qa_0">results challenging the reliability of wine tasting <span id="meco_para_7_qa_1">in both experts</span> and consumers have surfaced</span>. For example, studies showed that people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine: When tasters are given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive. Other studies show that tasters' judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, reputation, or other considerations. <span id="meco_para_7_qa_2">Objective wine tasting therefore requires the wine to be served blind</span> â€“ that is, without the taster having seen the label or bottle shape.
