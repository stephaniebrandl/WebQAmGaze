2,"The International Union for Conservation of Nature is an international organization working in the field of nature conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. Its mission is to 'influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable'. Over the past decades, the organization has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its projects. Unlike many other international environmental organizations, it does not aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. Instead, the organization tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for compiling and publishing the Red List of Threatened Species, which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide. Today, the organization employs approximately one thousand full-time staff in more than fifty countries.",meco_para_11,NR,,EN

They trained and conducted tests of their spacecraft at North American, and in the altitude chamber at the Kennedy Space Center. A ""plugs-out"" test was planned for January, which would simulate a launch countdown on LC-34 with the spacecraft transferring from pad-supplied to internal power. If successful, this would be followed by a more rigorous countdown simulation test closer to the February 21 launch, with both spacecraft and launch vehicle fueled.",a_Apolloprogram_2,NR,,EN

16,where  is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.:133–134:38-1–38-11,a_Force_4,IS,,EN

20,"Luther's hymns were frequently evoked by particular events in his life and the unfolding Reformation. This behavior started with his learning of the execution of Johann Esch and Heinrich Voes, the first individuals to be martyred by the Roman Catholic Church for Lutheran views, prompting Luther to write the hymn ""Ein neues Lied wir heben an"" (""A new song we raise""), which is generally known in English by John C.
