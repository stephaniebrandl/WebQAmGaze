2,"A vehicle registration plate is a metal or plastic plate attached to a vehicle for officialidentification purposes. All countries require registration plates for road vehicles such as cars, trucks,and motorcycles. Whether they are required for other vehicles, such as bicycles, boats, or tractors, may vary by jurisdiction. The registration identifier is a series of letters and digits that uniquely identifies the vehicle owner within the issuing region's vehicle register. In some countries, the identifier is unique within the entire country, while in others it is unique within a state or province. France was the first country to introduce the registration plate, in the late nineteenth century. Early twentieth century plates varied in size and shape from one jurisdiction to the next, such that if a person moved, new holes would need to be drilled into the automobile to support the new plate. Standardization of plates came in the late fifties, when automobile manufacturers came to an agreement with governments and international organizations.",meco_para_12,NR,,EN

16,where  is the relevant cross-sectional area for the volume for which the stress-tensor is being calculated. This formalism includes pressure terms associated with forces that act normal to the cross-sectional area (the matrix diagonals of the tensor) as well as shear terms associated with forces that act parallel to the cross-sectional area (the off-diagonal elements). The stress tensor accounts for forces that cause all strains (deformations) including also tensile stresses and compressions.:133–134:38-1–38-11,a_Force_4,IS,,EN

18,"Much of the work of the Scottish Parliament is done in committee. The role of committees is stronger in the Scottish Parliament than in other parliamentary systems, partly as a means of strengthening the role of backbenchers in their scrutiny of the government and partly to compensate for the fact that there is no revising chamber. The principal role of committees in the Scottish Parliament is to take evidence from witnesses, conduct inquiries and scrutinise legislation. Committee meetings take place on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday morning when Parliament is sitting. Committees can also meet at other locations throughout Scotland.",a_ScottishParliament_1,IS,,EN
