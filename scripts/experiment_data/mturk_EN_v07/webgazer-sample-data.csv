<p class=""webgaze-experiment"" id=""paragraph"">The plugs-out test began on the morning of <span id=""a_Apolloprogram_3_qa_1"">January 27, 1967</span>, and immediately was plagued with problems.

Then, communications problems frustrated the astronauts and forced a hold in the simulated countdown.

Pressure rose high enough from the fire that the cabin burst and the fire erupted onto the pad area, frustrating attempts to rescue the crew.
