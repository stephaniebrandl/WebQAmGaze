// In javascript, defining a function as `async` makes it return  a `Promise`
// that will "resolve" when the function completes. Below, `init` is assigned to be the
// *returned value* of immediately executing an anonymous async function.
// This is done by wrapping the async function in parentheses, and following the
// parentheses-wrapped function with `()`.
// Therefore, the code within the arrow function (the code within the curly brackets) immediately
// begins to execute when `init is defined. In the example, the `init` function only
// calls `psiTurk.preloadPages()` -- which, as of psiTurk 3, itself returns a Promise.
//
// The anonymous function is defined using javascript "arrow function" syntax.

 // In this example `task.js file, an anonymous async function is bound to `window.on('load')`.
 // The async function `await`s `init` before continuing with calling `psiturk.doInstructions()`.
 // This means that in `init`, you can `await` other Promise-returning code to resolve,
 // if you want it to resolve before your experiment calls `psiturk.doInstructions()`.

 // The reason that `await psiTurk.preloadPages()` is not put directly into the
 // function bound to `window.on('load')` is that this would mean that the pages
 // would not begin to preload until the window had finished loading -- an unnecessary delay.
