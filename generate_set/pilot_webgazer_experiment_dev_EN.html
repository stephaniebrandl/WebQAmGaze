                  <p><b>Task 1, the information searching task,</b> you will be presented with a question which you should read carefully. You will click a button to continue. Then, a paragraph will be presented which contains the answer to the question shown before. You can click any keyboard key to proceed. You will then see the same question again, but this time you will need to provide an answer based on the paragraph you read. This should be a noun, date or small passage. If you don't know the answer you need to write 'idk' to continue.
                  <p><b>Task 2, the normal reading task,</b> you will instead be presented with a paragraph you should read comprehensively. When done, click any key in the keyboard. After reading, you will need to answer a question about the paragraph, this time you will <b>be given a true or false response.</b>
                  <p>All these steps are preceded by a fixation cross, which you should focus on between steps.
                  <p>Between tasks, we will recalibrate the eye-tracker to ensure better data quality.
                  <p>Before each task you will be given an example.

    <p class="webgaze-experiment-compact" id="paragraph">In competitive sports, doping is the use of banned <span id="meco_para_3_qa_1">performance-enhancing drugs by athletic competitors</span>. The term doping is widely used by organizations which regulate sporting competitions. The use of drugs to enhance performance is largely considered unethical, and is therefore prohibited by most international sports organizations, including the International Olympic Committee. Furthermore, athletes who take explicit measures to evade detection exacerbate the ethical violation with overt deception and cheating. Despite its prevalence in the headlines recently, doping is not a new phenomenon; in fact, it is as old as sport itself. From the use of substances <span id="meco_para_3_qa_3">in ancient chariot races</span> to more recent controversies <span id="meco_para_3_qa_2">in baseball and cycling</span>, popular views among athletes have varied widely over the years. In recent decades, authorities and sporting organizations have tried to strictly regulate the use of drugs in sport. The primary reasons for this ban are the <span id="meco_para_3_qa_0">health risks of performance-enhancing drugs</span>, the equality of opportunity for athletes, and the positive example to the public set by drug-free sport. Anti-doping authorities have repeatedly emphasized that using performance-enhancing drugs goes against the 'spirit of sport'.</p>`,

While the practice of wine tasting is as ancient as its production, a more formalized methodology has slowly become established from the late middle ages onwards. Modern, professional wine tasters use a constantly evolving specialized terminology which is used to describe the range of perceived flavors, aromas and general characteristics of a wine. In recent years, <span id="meco_para_7_qa_0">results challenging the reliability of wine tasting <span id="meco_para_7_qa_1">in both experts</span> and consumers have surfaced</span>. For example, studies showed that people expect more expensive wine to have more desirable characteristics than less expensive wine: When tasters are given wine that they are falsely told is expensive they virtually always report it as tasting better than the very same wine when they are told that it is inexpensive. Other studies show that tasters' judgment can be prejudiced by knowing details of a wine, such as geographic origin, reputation, or other considerations. <span id="meco_para_7_qa_2">Objective wine tasting therefore requires the wine to be served blind</span> – that is, without the taster having seen the label or bottle shape.

    <p class="webgaze-experiment-compact" id="paragraph">The International Union for Conservation of Nature is <span id="meco_para_11_qa_0">an international organization</span> working in the field of nature conservation and the sustainable use of natural resources. It is involved in data gathering and analysis, research, field projects, advocacy, and education. Its mission is to 'influence, encourage and assist societies throughout the <span id="meco_para_11_qa_2">world to conserve nature and to ensure that any use of natural resources is equitable and ecologically sustainable'</span>. Over the past decades, the organization has widened its focus beyond conservation ecology and now incorporates issues related to sustainable development in its projects. Unlike many other international environmental organizations, it does not aim to mobilize the public in support of nature conservation. Instead, the organization tries to influence the actions of governments, business and other stakeholders by providing information and advice, and through building partnerships. The organization is best known to the wider public for <span id="meco_para_11_qa_3">compiling and publishing the Red List of Threatened Species</span>, which assesses the conservation status of species worldwide. Today, <span id="meco_para_11_qa_1">the organization employs approximately one thousand full-time staff</span> in more than fifty countries.</p>`,
